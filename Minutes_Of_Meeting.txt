CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is a design pattern that separates the responsibility for modifying data (commands) from the responsibility for reading data (queries). In other words, the CQRS pattern separates the read and write operations in a database, so that each operation can be optimized for its specific purpose.

In a CQRS architecture, the data is typically stored in two separate databases: one for handling write operations, and one for handling read operations. This separation allows the databases to be optimized for their specific purpose, and it also helps to ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate.

In a meeting on CQRS database design, participants might discuss the benefits and challenges of using this pattern, as well as potential strategies for implementing it in a specific project. They might also discuss how CQRS can be combined with other design patterns and technologies to improve the performance and scalability of the database. Additionally, they might talk about the need for careful planning and testing when using CQRS, in order to ensure that the data is organized and accessed in the most effective way possible.
